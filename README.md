Analysis script for the UK Parliament petition against a Scottish Independence Referendum

Although the proposal of the petition is "We in Scotland are fed up of persecution by the SNP leader who is solely intent on getting independence at any cost", only 72% of responses actually come from Scottish constituencies. In fact, it also includes responses from 109 countries from the rest of the world. Hmmm.
